## âœ… Pipeline Configuration

### Jenkins Pipeline
- [ ] Create new pipeline: `student-interaction-tracker`
- [ ] Configure Git repository URL
- [ ] Set branch specifier (e.g., `*/main`)
- [ ] Configure build triggers (Poll SCM: `H/5 * * * *`)
- [ ] Set pipeline definition to "Pipeline script from SCM"
- [ ] Set script path to `Jenkinsfile`

### Git Repository
- [ ] Push all files to Git repository:
  - [ ] Jenkinsfile
  - [ ] Dockerfile
  - [ ] docker-compose.yml
  - [ ] deploy.sh
  - [ ] All Python files
  - [ ] requirements.txt
  - [ ] README.md

## âœ… Testing

### Local Testing
- [ ] Test Docker build locally: `docker build -t test-image .`
- [ ] Test docker-compose locally: `docker-compose up --build`
- [ ] Test MongoDB connection locally
- [ ] Run test script: `python3 test_mongodb.py`

### Jenkins Testing
- [ ] Run manual build in Jenkins
- [ ] Check each stage:
  - [ ] Checkout stage
  - [ ] Build Docker Image stage
  - [ ] Test stage
  - [ ] Push to Docker Hub stage
  - [ ] Deploy to EC2 stage
  - [ ] Health Check stage
- [ ] Verify no errors in console output

### EC2 Testing
- [ ] Test deployment script: `./deploy.sh status`
- [ ] Test health check: `./deploy.sh health`
- [ ] Verify containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] Check application logs: `docker-compose logs -f`

## âœ… Production Readiness

### Security
